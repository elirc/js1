# Solutions and engineering review

[Course index](README.md) · [Practice prompts](05-PRACTICE.md)

Attempt each exercise before using these notes. These are solution approaches and review criteria, not claims that every extension has been implemented. The actual completed behavior is described in the worked-change chapter.

## Check a solution the same way the course checks its own

Every solution below should survive the same request chapter 03 runs; send it after your change and compare the response to the expected observations in chapter 03:

after(async () => {

## Existing implementation

Required text, money and calendar dates are validated; list pages have stable ID tie-breaking and clamp to available pages. Repeating a status leaves timestamps and history alone. A row lock and transaction commit the status and activity together; count and page rows use one repeatable-read snapshot. Currency inputs accept cent increments in the browser.

The key model is: The main record represents a field visit, responsible technician, service category and visit cost. Shared fields include id, title, owner, category, status, priority, amount, dueDate and notes. Statuses are Requested, Scheduled, On Site, Complete, Cancelled. Categories are Install, Repair, Inspection, Training. Activities reference the record ID. PostgreSQL stores records and activities; API mappers convert snake_case columns to camelCase JSON.

The worked fixture should behave as follows: Create a synthetic record with amount 12.50 and dueDate 2028-02-29. Change Requested to Scheduled, then repeat Scheduled: only one status activity should exist. Request page 999 after creating three matching rows with pageSize 2: the last page contains one row. Reject an impossible date and verify the old record is unchanged.

## Extension solutions

### Exercise 1

**Prompt:** Add a visible due-soon filter with a precisely defined date window.

**Approach:** Compare valid calendar labels against today and a documented inclusive end date; preserve other filters and reset or clamp pagination.

**Review:** Demonstrate an ordinary case and a case that would break a naive implementation. Explain which existing invariant remains unchanged. Keep the code and the learner-facing explanation in agreement.

### Exercise 2

**Prompt:** Add a reason to an actual status transition.

**Approach:** Validate a bounded reason and save it with the transition event. A same-value command should not invent another transition.

**Review:** Demonstrate an ordinary case and a case that would break a naive implementation. Explain which existing invariant remains unchanged. Keep the code and the learner-facing explanation in agreement.

### Exercise 3

**Prompt:** Test deletion of the final row on a filtered last page.

**Approach:** Create three matching records with size two, delete the last row and request the old page. Assert both the returned page number and matching IDs.

**Review:** Demonstrate an ordinary case and a case that would break a naive implementation. Explain which existing invariant remains unchanged. Keep the code and the learner-facing explanation in agreement.

### Exercise 4

**Prompt:** Design conflict detection for two people editing the same full record.

**Approach:** Return a version number and require the expected version on update. Reject stale writes with a clear conflict response; keep the learner draft available for comparison. Row locking alone does not detect an edit based on an old screen.

**Review:** Demonstrate an ordinary case and a case that would break a naive implementation. Explain which existing invariant remains unchanged. Keep the code and the learner-facing explanation in agreement.

## Review questions with answer guidance

**Why not trust input just because it came from this UI?** A caller can bypass the UI, a saved file can be edited, and older data can have a different shape. Validate at the boundary that owns the operation.

**Why keep the id stable?** It identifies the same domain record across views and edits. Changing it can create duplicates, disconnect child records or make reconciliation impossible.

**What makes the failure test meaningful?** It observes the promised state invariant. For this project, explain exactly why the failing scenario in [test/workflow.test.ts](../test/workflow.test.ts) would detect the original or a plausible regression.

**What does the test not prove?** A bounded suite does not prove all concurrency, browsers, deployment configurations or unrelated domain behavior. Name the real limitation from this lesson instead of adding a generic disclaimer.

**When should you extract a helper?** When it isolates a coherent responsibility, makes an invariant clearer or enables a meaningful test without duplicating application logic. A pure validator and a shared persistence boundary are common examples, but do not abstract solely to increase the number of files.

## A sample change explanation

“The previous behavior was: Loose values could reach string operations or SQL, page requests could land beyond the result set, and repeated status commands created misleading history. I changed the implementation so that: Required text, money and calendar dates are validated; list pages have stable ID tie-breaking and clamp to available pages. Repeating a status leaves timestamps and history alone. A row lock and transaction commit the status and activity together; count and page rows use one repeatable-read snapshot. Currency inputs accept cent increments in the browser. The strongest evidence is the regression that exercises the worked fixture and checks authoritative state. A remaining design question is the final stretch exercise.”

Replace that explanation with your own words and actual test results. A strong junior engineer can connect a concrete user problem to code, verification and a clearly stated limit. Completing that explanation independently is the final checkpoint for this course.
