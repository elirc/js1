# Codebase map and reading order

[Course index](README.md)

## The problem this project solves

Malformed socket events could call trim on nonstrings; listener startup occurred during import and asynchronous failures could escape their handlers. The improvement you will study is: Room fields and socket messages are validated. Runtime start/stop functions enable isolated tests; malformed messages are ignored, database failures close the affected socket, and the payload size is bounded.

## Data model

Rooms have id, slug and name. Messages have id, roomId, author, body and createdAt. WebSockets subscribe to room IDs, while PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY delivers committed message notifications to the process.

An object is a named collection of fields. An array is an ordered collection of values. An id answers “which record?”; an index answers “where is it in this array right now?” Those questions are different whenever the list can be filtered, reordered or edited. Persisted data is the form that must survive a process/page restart. Derived data can be recomputed from that persisted state.

## Trace one action

1. A React form, button or test sends a concrete operation.
2. The client serializes editable values as an HTTP request or WebSocket event.
3. The server validates runtime input and the relevant record relationships.
4. The repository or model reads authoritative state and performs the documented change.
5. The storage boundary commits or rejects the operation.
6. The response or broadcast gives the client its observed result.

This diagram names responsibilities, not necessarily separate files. A small browser program can keep them in app.js. A larger API spreads them across controllers, services and models. Follow the actual sequence above rather than assuming every repository has the same architecture.

## Where to read first

1. [server/src/index.ts](../server/src/index.ts): locate `connectSocket` and read its inputs, branches and return/side effects.
2. [test/chat.test.ts](../test/chat.test.ts): read the scenario names before the helper code.
3. The root [README](../README.md): connect setup and the larger application workflow.

## A practical reading technique

At each function boundary, write down the value coming in, the value going out and any side effect. A side effect includes a storage write, SQL query, network request, timer registration or DOM update. If a function calls another function, inspect only that next dependency until you can finish the chosen trace. Return to unrelated files later.

For this lesson, start with: **Connect to study, wait for presence, send malformed JSON, null, and an object-valued author, then send Trace this insert. The valid message broadcasts and appears once in HTTP history. Creating study twice returns 409.** Mark where the id, time, amount or other important value changes representation. For example, JSON serializes values into text; a date field may be a calendar string; SQL aggregates may return a different type from individual rows. Representation changes are common bug locations.

## Check your understanding

Without reading the solution, answer: Who owns the mutable state? Which input is untrusted? Which function first decides whether the operation is valid? What survives reload or restart? What observation would prove that the operation partially failed? Point to a source file for each answer, rather than describing a generic app from memory.
